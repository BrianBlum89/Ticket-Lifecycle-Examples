Agents will be able to see live tickets in the agent panel. From there managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents as well as assigning proper SLAs.

In this example we will be setting the priority level of the ticket. Since this has a wide impact and effects all our customers we will set its Priority to Emergency. I have also changed the SLA plan to SEV-A  and assigned the ticket to a top level technician John.
